# Map My World
The purpose of this repository is to create a [2D occupancy grid](/docs/2D_Occupancy_Grid_Map.png) and [3D map](/docs/MapMyWorld.png) from a simulated environment using [robot](/my_robot/) with the [RTAB-Map](https://introlab.github.io/rtabmap/). 

The steps are listed as [summary of tasks](task_summary.txt).

## Description
Inside the [Gazebo world](https://github.com/sidharth2189/RoboND-GazeboWorld/blob/main/images/office.png) one can identify:

* Two wheeled Robot with caster.
* Sensors (lidar and camera) mounted on the robot.

### Node view

Node view for graph-based SLAM using rtabmaps for [my_robot](/my_robot/)
<img src="/docs/rqt_graph.png"/>

### Dependencies

* Operating System — Ubuntu 16.04 LTS. ([Udacity VM Image](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-robotics/Virtual+Machines/Lubuntu_071917/RoboVM_V2.1.0.zip))
  *  Please refer steps for usage of VM, resource allocation and first boot [here](/docs/VM.txt).

* [rtabmaps ros](http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros)
  * If the package is unavailable for above VM (ros kinetic), please install as below.
  ```sudo apt-get install ros-kinetic-rtabmap-ros```

* Git LFS: The generated database is [stored](/my_robot/rtabmap/rtabmap.db) as an LFS file due to its size. Please [install git LFS](https://github.com/git-lfs/git-lfs/blob/main/INSTALLING.md) on system to be able to not have issues fetching this file.

### Installing
* To verify installation, run
```
gazebo
```

### How to run
* Update and upgrade the Workspace
```
sudo apt-get update && sudo apt-get upgrade -y
```
* Create a [catkin workspace](https://wiki.ros.org/catkin/conceptual_overview)
```
$ mkdir -p ~/catkin_ws/src
```
* Navigate to source directory
```
$ cd ~/catkin_ws/src
```
* Initialize the catkin workspace which will create a ```CMakeLists.txt``` file.
```
catkin_init_workspace
```
* Clone this repository and its submodules.
```
git clone https://github.com/sidharth2189/RoboND-MapMyWorld.git
```
```
git submodule update --init --recursive
```
* Copy ```my_robot``` and [```teleop_twist_keyboard```](https://github.com/ros-teleop/teleop_twist_keyboard) packages into the source folder for catkin workspace.```/catkin_ws/src```
* Navigate to catkin workspace.
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/
```
* Build packages.Note that the command is issued from within the top level directory (i.e., within ```catkin_ws``` NOT ```catkin_ws/src```) 
```
catkin_make
```
* Source the set up script of the workspace. 
```
source devel/setup.bash
```
* To check for missing package.
```
rosdep check <package name>
```
* Launch the robot inside the world. Alongside Gazebo, this also open rviz for visualization.
```
roslaunch my_robot world.launch
```
* Launch teleop in another terminal.
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch my_robot teleop.launch
```
* Launch localization using rtbmaps in another terminal.
```
cd ~/catkin_ws/
source devel/setup.bash
roslaunch my_robot localization.launch
```
  * Please note that, in the launch file, setting the parameter ```Mem/IncrementalMemory``` to ```false```, causes [empty working memory](/docs/warning_memory.png)
  * Hence, it is set to ```true```.
* Navigate robot in the simulation to create map for the environment.
* When this is done, terminal the node and the map db file can be found in the place specified in the launch file. If the argument is not modified, it will be located in the ```/root/.ros/``` folder.
* Database analysis: ```rtabmap-databaseViewer``` is used for exploring database after generation. It is isolated from ROS and allows for complete analysis of mapping session.
* Open map database as below
```
rtabmap-databaseViewer ~/.ros/rtabmap.db
```
<img src="/docs/rtabmap_databseViewer.png"/>

* Add some windows to get a better view of the relevant information.
  * Say yes to using the database parameters
  * View -> Constraint View
  * View -> Graph View
  * On the left, you have your 2D grid map in all of its updated iterations and the path of your robot.
  * In the middle you have different images from the mapping process. Here you can scrub through images to see all of the features from your detection algorithm. These features are in yellow. The pink indicates where two images have features in common and this information is being used to create neighboring links and loop closures!
  * Finally, on the right you can see the constraint view. This is where you can identify where and how the neighboring links and loop closures were created.
  * You can see the number of loop closures in the bottom left.
  * The codes stand for the following: Neighbor, Neighbor Merged, Global Loop closure, Local loop closure by space, Local loop closure by time, User loop closure, and Prior link.  

### Best practices
* One can start with lower velocities.
* The Goal is to create a great map with the least amount of passes as possible.
* Maximize loop closures by going over similar paths two or three times. 
* This allows for the maximization of feature detection, facilitating faster loop closures

### Advanced tuning parameters
* Please take a look at the [advanced tuning parameters](http://wiki.ros.org/rtabmap_ros/Tutorials/Advanced%20Parameter%20Tuning)
* Based on optimization robsutness as discussed in [knowledge hub](https://knowledge.udacity.com/questions/714369), following line is added to [localization launch file](/my_robot/launch/localization.launch)
```
<param name="Optimizer/Robust" type="string" value="true"/>
```
